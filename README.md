# Data-Analysis-Project

About Me

This is my first project as a data analyst, I have been studying data analytics since September 2021. 

This project was focused on utilising SQL, Excel and Power BI. 

The dataset used for this project was the World Happiness Reports from 2019 and 2020. 

The skills gained during this project were;
SQL: Aggregators, Group By, Case When, Where and Joins
Excel: Max and Min and Sum
Power BI: Dashboard Creation, transforming data

The tools used in this project were;
SQL, Excel and Power BI 

What I have learnt from this project;
I have learnt that Western Europe dominates the most countries at the top of the World Happiness Scores and that Sub- Saharan Africa has the most countries with the least happiest countries. I have also learnt how certain factors such as freedom of choice and healthy life expectancy affect these scores as we can see from Countries like the UK who had a drop in their world happiness score in 2020 as compared to 2019 when Covid hit and things such as Lockdowns and high rates of death affected these variables. 

I would recommend that regions such as Sub-Saharan Africa focus and generate money on things such as healthcare and social support so that other variables such as healthy life expectancy improve and in turn their happiness scores as citizens would feel a lot more happier and satisfied.
